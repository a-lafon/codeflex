# CodeFlex

An AI-powered development assistant designed to streamline developer workflows and improve code quality.

## üöÄ Overview

CodeFlex helps developers automate code review tasks and ensure implementations match requirements. It acts as an intelligent companion to reduce manual overhead and maintain consistent quality standards.

## üéØ Current Features

### Code Review
- **Analyze merge/pull requests** for code quality, style conventions, and potential issues
- **Validate implementation against ticket requirements** to ensure proper feature delivery
- **Provide constructive feedback** with specific improvement suggestions

### Documentation
- **Generate comprehensive documentation** from merge request content
- **Produce well-structured Markdown** with code examples and technical details
- **Focus on specific documentation areas** based on your needs

## üíª Installation

```bash
# Coming soon
npm install -g codeflex
```

## üìã Usage Examples

```bash
# Review code quality
codeflex review -m MR-789 -p PROJECT-ID

# Validate implementation against Jira ticket requirements
codeflex ticket-review -m MR-789 -p PROJECT-ID

# Override Jira ticket ID
codeflex ticket-review -m MR-789 -p PROJECT-ID -j JIRA-123

# Generate documentation from a merge request
codeflex generate-docs -m MR-789 -p PROJECT-ID -o docs/feature.md

# Additional documentation options
codeflex generate-docs -m MR-789 -p PROJECT-ID --include-apis --include-code-examples --json

# Additional review options
--detail-level <basic|standard|thorough>  # Set review detail level
--focus <areas>                           # Focus on specific areas (comma-separated)
--ignore <patterns>                       # Ignore files matching patterns
--verbose                                 # Show detailed information
--project-guidelines <path>               # Path to project guidelines file
```

## üöß Future Enhancements

### Short-term Improvements
3. **Custom Rule Configuration** - Configuration via `.codeflex.json` file
4. **Multilingual Output** - Generate reviews in different languages
5. **Review Consistency Engine** - Ensure uniform reviews by learning from past analyses

### Future Features
1. **Automated Ticket Creation** from natural language descriptions
2. **Test Generation** based on ticket specifications
3. **Effort Estimation** for implementing tickets
4. **Regression Detection** by comparing PRs with bug history
5. **Security Analysis** to detect potential vulnerabilities
6. **Organizational Learning** - Build a knowledge base of code patterns and solutions

## üí° Planned Review Consistency Engine

A key planned feature for CodeFlex is a built-in consistency engine that will automatically deliver uniform, reliable code reviews:

### How It Will Work
1. Every time a code review is saved, it will become part of the knowledge base
2. For new reviews, the system will identify relevant past reviews
3. These past reviews will guide the AI to maintain consistent terminology, structure and quality standards
4. Each new review will build organizational knowledge, making future reviews even better

### Expected Benefits
- **Predictable Feedback**: Developers will receive consistent guidance across reviews
- **Self-Improving System**: Review quality will improve over time with more usage
- **Organizational Memory**: Will capture and preserve review standards and conventions
- **Cost-Effective**: Will reuse existing data without requiring additional AI processing

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

- Command Line Interface (CLI) for seamless workflow integration
- Simple command structure: `codeflex <command> [options]`
- Integrates with GitHub, GitLab, and JIRA
